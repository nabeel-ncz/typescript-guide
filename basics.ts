/*

Syntax

TypeScript uses postfix type annotations to denote the type of something. 
This can be seen with variables, function parameters, function return types, 
class property types and more.

/*

Basic types

TypeScript exposes the JavaScript primitives, as well as a couple of extra types

string - the type is a primitive JavaScript string. E.g. "hello".
number - the type is a primitive JavaScript number. E.g. 10.
boolean - the type is a primitive JavaScript boolean. E.g. true.
any - the type is anything.
any[] - the type is an array of any.
void - no type, effectively undefined.
() => any - the type is a function that returns any
